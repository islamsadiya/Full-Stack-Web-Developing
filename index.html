<main><h1>Full Stack Web Developmebnt</h1><p><b>Full Stack Web Development</b> is the process of designing and building both the front-end (what users see) and back-end (how the website works) of a web application. A full stack developer handles everything — from creating interactive web pages using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to managing databases, servers, and APIs with technologies like Node.js, Python, or PHP. This combination of skills allows developers to build complete, functional, and dynamic websites from start to finish.</p>

    <h2>html</h2>
    <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create and structure web pages. It provides the skeleton of a website by defining elements like headings, paragraphs, images, links, lists, and forms. HTML uses tags to mark up content so that web browsers can display it correctly. While HTML structures the content, it is often combined with CSS for styling and JavaScript for interactivity, making it an essential foundation of web development.</p>

    <h2>CSS</h2><p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language used to style and format the content of web pages written in HTML. While HTML provides the structure of a page, CSS controls its appearance — such as colors, fonts, layouts, spacing, and responsiveness. Using CSS, developers can create visually appealing websites, implement designs consistently across multiple pages, and make web pages adapt to different screen sizes. CSS works through selectors and properties, and it can be applied inline, internal, or external to HTML.</p>

    <section><h2>javascript</h2><p> 
        JavaScript is a powerful programming language used to make web pages interactive and dynamic. While HTML provides the structure and CSS adds styling, JavaScript allows developers to create features like image sliders, form validation, pop-ups, animations, and real-time updates. It can run directly in the browser and can also be used on the server-side with platforms like Node.js. JavaScript works with the Document Object Model (DOM) to manipulate web page elements and respond to user actions, making websites more engaging and functional.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xKpED7UCLv8?si=CM8p4O3xmrNpYlKN" title="js" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></section>

            <h2>python</h2><p>Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It is widely used for web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, machine learning, automation, and more. Python’s syntax is easy to understand, making it beginner-friendly, yet powerful enough for advanced programming tasks. It supports object-oriented, procedural, and functional programming styles and has a large ecosystem of libraries and frameworks like Django, Flask, Pandas, and TensorFlow, which help developers build applications efficiently.</p>

It is used to create dynamic web pages that can interact with databases, handle forms, manage sessions, and perform server-side tasks. PHP code is executed on the server, and the result (usually HTML) is sent to the user’s browser. It is compatible with many databases, especially MySQL, and is widely used in content management systems like WordPress. PHP is easy to learn, open-source, and powers a large portion of the web.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_TST9dVptls?si=ShIayjnolT1EgjdS&amp;start=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></section><section><h2>React</h2><p>React is a JavaScript library used for building user interfaces, especially for single-page applications. It allows developers to create reusable UI components that efficiently update and render when data changes. React uses a virtual DOM to improve performance and provides a declarative way to design interactive UIs. It is maintained by Facebook and widely used in modern web development to create fast, dynamic, and scalable applications.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6wilewRV3xQ?si=5EF4Ly-30nmTdWnA&amp;start=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></section></main>
